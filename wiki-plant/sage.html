          <p><strong>Common name:</strong> Sage</p>
          <p><strong>Scientific plant name:</strong><em> Salvia officinalis L.</em></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Origin:</strong> It is native to the Southeastern Europe and prefers a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and long summers, though it has been naturalized in many places throughout the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Harvest season:</strong> It is a perennial, evergreen subshrub, with woody stems, grayish leaves, and blue to purplish flowers. In general, we can harvest 2 or even 3 times a year. However, performing multiple harvesting sessions per year is not an easy task and requires experience. It may also require irrigation and fertilization between the harvesting sessions so that the plants will be encouraged to regenerate quickly. We can proceed to multiple harvesting sessions from the second year onwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Production:</strong> Today, although cultivated in some European countries (e.g., Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, and Spain) and the United States, more than half of the worldâ€™s supply is still wild-collected (mainly in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro), with increasing amounts being wild-collected under organic certification.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Health benefits:</strong> Salvia officinalis has been used since ancient times for warding off evil, snakebites, increasing women's fertility, and more. Pliny the Elder said the latter plant was called salvia by the Romans, and used as a diuretic, a local anesthetic for the skin, a styptic, and for other uses. The plant had a high reputation throughout the Middle Ages, with many sayings referring to its healing properties and value. It was sometimes called S. salvatrix (sage the savior). Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen all recommended sage as a diuretic, hemostatic, emmenagogue, and tonic. In past centuries, it was also used for hair care, insect bites and wasp stings, nervous conditions, mental conditions, oral preparations for inflammation of the mouth, tongue and throat, and also to reduce fevers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>History of plant usage and discovery:</strong> Salvia officinalis was used medicinally by ancient societies in Greece, Egypt, and Rome.3 Traditionally, it was employed to increase fertility, stop bleeding, heal minor skin wounds, treat hoarseness or cough, and improve memory function.3 The English herbalist John Gerard (1545-1607) claimed that sage (usually a tea made from the leaves) was good for the head, brain, and memory,13 and the physician/herbalist Nicholas Culpeper (1616-1654) also thought that it improved memory.
