            As a home page, it will show the face of the site. Therefore, it needs to catch the user’s eye and quickly communicate what the site is about. In the hero, I choose both the name of the site and its purpose with a brief sentence.

            Wiki-plant -- Your best reference for plant-based extracts. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat. Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.” -Daniel 1:12-16
            <br>
            <br>
            On this page, along with the plants' panel and description, Daniel's biblical reference and quotation will fill one of the sections. Besides the quote, a brief explanation of the prophet Daniel's conversations with king Nebuchadnezzar II's butler will follow. It explains how Daniel and his young partners refused to eat the king's food because it was non-kosher food or God had forbidden them to eat otherwise. So instead, he suggested being fed with beans, cereals, nuts, fruit, and pure water – not even sodas. In the aftermath, the officials witnessed that these young Jews were healthier and more potent than those who did not observe God's commandments on food.
            Interestingly, Daniel's diet was plant-based. Over time, humans have forgotten the importance of what we eat and how we eat. Over the last two hundred years of frenetic industrial food processing, most of us have lost connection with what nature offers. God created this world with a purpose, and more interestingly, He guided humans on how to use resources wisely, including how to feed our bodies.

        <h3>Plants [Page 2 through Page 10]</h3>
        <p>
            On this page, specific data for each plant will display, including plant name, scientific plant name, origin, harvest season, and health benefits—some gripping information about the history of the plant usage and its discovery. In addition, I include a sample of what one of the nine additional pages will content here. Although similar in style, each page will differ from the others since its content will be specific to the plant.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Plant name:</strong> Saffron
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Scientific plant name:</strong> Crocus sativus
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Origin:</strong> It is mainly believed that saffron originated in Iran. Nevertheless, Greece and Mesopotamia have also been suggested as possible regions of origin.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Harvest season:</strong> It is an autumn-flowering perennial plant.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Production:</strong> Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain to India and Pakistan in the east. Today, 90% of the global production takes place in Iran, but due to international political sanctions, the list is led by Spain in 2021 with 396,417 Kg.
            <br>
            <br>
            Source: <em>World Bank Organization Spices; saffron exports by country |2021 (worldbank.org)</em> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Health benefits:</strong> Saffron constituents, such as safranal, crocetin, and crocin, are believed to affect mental depression and possibly cardiovascular risk factors. However, there is still no high-quality clinical evidence for such effects.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>History of plant usage and discovery</strong> Saffron-based pigments are found in 50,000-year-old depictions of prehistoric places in northwest Iran. The Sumerians later used wild-growing saffron in their remedies and magical potions. Over thousands of years, many cultures wove saffron threads into textiles, ritually offered to divinities. Also, it was used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes. Even Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his infusions, rice, and baths to cure his battle wounds.

        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            This page will briefly describe the site’s purpose. I will avoid irrelevant imagery to maintain the user’s focus.
            <br><br>
            "Wiki-plant aims to be an independent source of knowledge about natural plant extracts. The primary purpose of this site is to provide solid and reliable information about a handful of highly demanded plant extracts, including their origin, harvesting seasons, and methods. In addition, it gives scientifically backed specifications and their applications to improve overall health and remedy some illnesses. If you are interested in learning about plant extracts and trying to find the right plant-based product to improve health challenges, you are already part of the Wiki-plant audience.
            With more than 15 years in the nutraceutical industry, we are ready to transfer our scientific knowledge and experience and connect the general public with local producers, including farmers, co-ops, or large food companies, to get all of Nature's benefits. All in all, any human activity performed without consciousness will fail in the long term. Beyond our commitment to our users and stakeholders, so are we to Earth. Thus, sustainability imprints the process of gathering and analyzing data about the impact of our work. We encourage all our direct or indirect sources and collaborators to do the same. We have one life and one Earth to live in, so let us make it right."
