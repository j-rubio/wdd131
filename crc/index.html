      <h3>Jewish Law & Daily Rituals</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>Written vs. Oral Law:</summary>
        <p>
          The Written Law (Torah Shebiktav) refers to the Five Books of Moses.
          The Oral Law (Torah Sheba’al Peh) includes the interpretations and
          details given to Moses at Sinai (later recorded in the Mishnah and
          Talmud) that explain how to fulfill the Written Law’s commandments.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Meal with Bread:</summary>
        <p>
          The first requirement is to wash your hands (Netilat Yadayim) before
          reciting the blessing of Hamotzi.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Morning Hand Washing Method:</summary>
        <p>
          Use a vessel to pour water over your hands alternating between right
          and left three times (Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left) up to the
          wrist.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>First Action Upon Waking:</summary>
        <p>
          Recite the Modeh Ani prayer to thank Hashem for returning your soul.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How to Wash (Morning):</summary>
        <p>(Duplicate of #3) Alternate three times on each hand using a cup.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Why Wash in the Morning:</summary>
        <p>
          Two main reasons: 1) To remove the "unclean spirit" (ruach ra) that
          rests on the hands during sleep, and 2) To purify oneself for the
          service of Hashem, similar to a Priest in the Temple.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Meat to Dairy / Dairy to Meat:</summary>
        <p>
          - **Meat to Dairy**: Wait **6 hours**. - **Dairy to Meat**: No waiting
          is required for most dairy (just rinse the mouth and wash hands), but
          for **hard/aged cheese**, one must wait **6 hours**.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Parve:</summary>
        <p>
          Refers to neutral foods that are neither meat nor dairy (e.g., fruits,
          vegetables, fish, eggs) and can be eaten with either.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Mezuzah:</summary>
        <p>
          - **What it is**: A parchment scroll attached to doorposts. -
          **Inside**: Hand-written verses from the Torah (the first two
          paragraphs of the *Shema*). - **Purpose**: To serve as a constant
          reminder of Hashem’s presence, our commitment to His commandments, and
          to distinguish a Jewish home.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Prayer Requirements:</summary>
        <p>
          Men are required to pray three times daily (Shacharit, Mincha,
          Ma’ariv). Women are required to pray at least once daily (though many
          opinions require twice), focusing on seeking Divine mercy.
        </p>

      </details>

          [cRc].
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Blessing:</summary>
        <p>
          Baruch atah... asher kidshanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner shel
          Shabbat.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Guest Rule:</summary>
        <p>
          A guest is generally covered by the host’s lighting, but many have the
          custom to light their own or contribute a small amount to the host’s
          candles.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Hospital Lighting:</summary>
        <p>
          One should use electric lights (with a blessing) if fire is not
          permitted for safety reasons.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Mitzvah Without Blessing:</summary>
        <p>
          Yes, you still fulfilled the obligation (the blessing is a Rabbinic
          requirement, but the act is the mitzvah itself) [cRc].
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Eating/Drinking Before Kiddush:</summary>
        <p>

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Leftover Wine:</summary>
        <p>
          If someone drank directly from the cup, the wine is "pagum"
          (blemished). It should be fixed by adding a little fresh wine/juice
          before being used for Kiddush again.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Stam Yeinam:</summary>

        <p>
          One must drink at least a melo lugmav (a cheekful), roughly half of
          a revi’it. If not drunk, the obligation is generally not fulfilled.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Listeners' Drinking:</summary>
        <p>
          Only the person reciting Kiddush must drink, but it is a mitzvah for
          listeners to taste some as well.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Sit or Stand:</summary>
        <p>
          Customs vary; Ashkenazim often stand for the first part and sit for
          the blessing over wine, while others stand for the entire Kiddush.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Speaking After Kiddush:</summary>
        <p>
          If one spoke before drinking, they must repeat the blessing on the
          wine, but not the entire Kiddush text.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Repeating for Others:</summary>
        <p>

          Kiddush for someone who hasn't heard it yet (Arvut).
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Response to Hashem's Name:</summary>
        <p>
          Say "Baruch Hu u'varuch Shemo" (Blessed is He and blessed is His
          name).
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Kiddush Without Wine:</summary>
        <p>
          One may make Kiddush over Challah (bread) by substituting the wine
          blessing with Hamotzi.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why Covered:</summary>
