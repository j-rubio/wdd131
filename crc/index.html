        <p>
          <b>The Written Law</b><em>(Torah Shebiktav)</em> refers to the Five
          Books of Moses.<br />
          <b>The Oral Law</b><em>(Torah Sheba’al Peh)</em> includes the
          interpretations and details given to Moses at Sinai (later recorded in
          the <em>Mishnah</em> and <em>Talmud</em>) that explain how to fulfill
          the Written Law’s commandments.

        <summary>Why Wash in the Morning:</summary>
        <p>
          Two main reasons:<br />

          during sleep, and<br />
          2. To purify oneself for the service of Hashem, similar to a Priest in
          the Temple.

      <details>
        <summary>Mitzvah Without Blessing:</summary>

      <details>
        <summary>Sit or Stand:</summary>

        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Speaking After Kiddush:</summary>
        <p>
          If one spoke before drinking, they must repeat the blessing on the
          wine, but not the entire Kiddush text.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
