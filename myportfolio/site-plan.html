      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This portfolio website introduces me as a software developer with a
        strong background in electronic engineering and IT, showcasing the
        technologies, programming languages, and tools I have worked with. It
        highlights my transition into software development, shares my
        educational and professional journey, and features a collection of my
        recent projects.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The site is intended for potential employers, collaborators, and peers
        in the tech industry who are interested in my technical skills, past
        experience, and current capabilities as a developer.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        I will use JavaScript with ES modules to dynamically generate and inject
        reusable components—such as the header, footer, avatar, project cards,
        and tech icons—into my HTML pages. Each component will be defined in its
        own module for modularity and maintainability, allowing me to import and
        render them on specific pages like the Home or Technologies sections.
        Additionally, I'll use utility modules to manage shared data (e.g.,
        arrays of objects for projects or technologies) and helper functions for
        tasks like loading stylesheets dynamically or generating internal
        navigation links. This structure helps keep my codebase organized and
        allows my site content to be easily updated through JavaScript rather
        than hardcoded HTML.
      </p>

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a href="https://coolors.co/ffffff-1c1c1c-121212-fd1e1c" target="_blank"
        >https://coolors.co/ffffff-1c1c1c-121212-fd1e1c</a
      >

      <table class="colors">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Primary</th>
            <th>Secondary</th>
            <th>Accent 1</th>
            <th>Accent 2</th>
          </tr>
          <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
          <tr>
            <td class="primary">[#ffffff]</td>
            <td class="secondary">[#1c1c1c]</td>
            <td class="accent1">[#121212]</td>
            <td class="accent2">[#fd1e1c]</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
      For my headlines I use Lato, and for paragraphs the same font type. It is
      clean and modern, and make it a good fit for digital content. 
      <h4>
        Heading Font: Lato, sans-serif
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Lato, sans-serif
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>

        tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim

      </p>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
      <nav>

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my Portfolio: Hi, I am Julio Rubio—an electronics engineer turned 
        software developer. After over a decade working in the electronics industry 
        in maintenance and IT roles, I shifted focus to software development to 
        continue solving problems with technology in new and creative ways. This 
        portfolio highlights the tools and technologies I have worked with, the projects
        I’ve built, and the journey that brought me here. Whether you're a
        potential employer, collaborator, or fellow tech enthusiast, I'm glad
        you're here!

      <h3>TechStack Page</h3>
      <p>
        Technologies & Tools I Work With: Over the past few years, I’ve built 
        experience in both hardware and software domains. I’ve studied and used 
        a wide range of programming languages, libraries, and platforms, including
        JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C, C#, R, tools like Git, GitHub, VS Code, Figma, 
        and various IoT platforms. I'm familiar with concepts like responsive design, modular architecture, RESTful APIs, data visualization, and embedded systems. I’m
        always exploring new technologies and refining my skills to stay up-to-date in this ever-evolving field.

      <h3>Project Page</h3>
      <p>
        Featured Projects: Here are a few of the recent projects I have built or contributed to. 
        Each project showcases different skills—from front-end development to data analysis
        and IoT integration. Here I insert dynamic project cards with title, brief
        description, tech stack used, and a live link or GitHub repository.
        Whether it's building user-friendly interfaces or working with hardware
        and sensors, I bring curiosity, precision, and creativity to every
        project.
      </p>
      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <!-- <p>
        Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
        here
      </p> -->

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        The wireframes focus on structure and layout, but they leave out
        important content, interaction, and visual design details. For instance,
        in the home page the avatar's style will be realistic, and a grading
        color pallete will reinforce my personal brand. I will use a sticky
        header that will stay at the top while scrolling. In addition, a
        hamburger menu appear under 700px to comply with the responsive design.
        The footer includes actionable links to phone and email. Also, I plan to
        use a background video if that does not penalize performance.
      </p>

      <h3>TechStack</h3>
      <p>
        The "Technologies I have worked with" will be an icon grid with hover
        effects.
      </p>
      <img src="./site-plan-images/TechStackPage.png" width="600" alt="home page wireframe" />
      <h3>Projects Page</h3>
      <p>
        The recent projects will show 1-6 featured project cards with short
        descriptions, links, and images.
